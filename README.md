The approach includes Unsupervised Learning by implementing the k-Means algorithm to create customer segments for a better marketing strategy as well as understanding the underlying attributes of the customers. Keep in mind that this approach is for educational purposes to discuss the main properties of K-Means and Unsupervised learning. In a real business setting, the modelling would conclude additinal variables to structure the segments.
