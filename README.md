# Mall_Customer_Segmentation
# Context
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis.

The repository demonstrates my analysis of the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset found on Kaggle. The approach includes Unsupervised Learning by implementing the k-Means algorithm to create customer segments for a better marketing strategy as well as understanding the underlying attributes of the customers. Keep in mind that this approach is for educational purposes to discuss the main properties of K-Means and Unsupervised learning. In a real business setting, the modelling would conclude additinal variables to structure the segments.

# Content
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

Problem Statement: You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.
